## [0.1.4] - 2024-04-04

### Added

### Changed

- code: skip `Tokenizer` memory-related tests on non-Linux systems, since
  support for RLIMIT_AS is inconsistent.
- code: reduce increase atol on end-to-end Transformer forward pass tests.
- code: remove dropout in model-related tests to improve determinism across
  platforms.

- code: increase atol on cross-entropy tests

### Fixed

- handout: fix signature of `Tokenizer.__init__` to include `self`.
- handout: mention that `Tokenizer.from_files` should be a class method.
- handout: clarify list of model hyperparameters listed in `adamwAccounting`.
- handout: clarify that `adamwAccounting` (b) considers a GPT-2 XL-shaped model
  (with our architecture), not necessarily the literal GPT-2 XL model.
- handout: moved softmax problem to where softmax is first mentioned (Scaled Dot-Product Attention, Section 3.4.3)

## [0.1.3] - 2024-04-02

  to `Tokenizer.decode` that correspond to invalid UTF-8 bytes.

### Fixed

## [0.1.2] - 2024-04-02

### Added

- handout: added some more information about submitting to the leaderboard.

### Changed

### Fixed

## [0.1.1] - 2024-04-01

### Added

- code: add a note to README.md that pull requests and issues are welcome and
  encouraged.

### Changed

- handout: edit motivation for pre-tokenization to include a note about
  desired behavior with tokens that differ only in punctuation.
- handout: remove total number of points after each section.
- handout: mention that large language models (e.g., LLaMA and GPT-3) often use
  AdamW betas of (0.9, 0.95) (in contrast to the PyTorch defaults of (0.9, 0.999)).
- handout: explicitly mention the deliverable in the `adamw` problem.
- code: rename `test_serialization::test_checkpoint` to
  `test_serialization::test_checkpointing` to match the handout.
- code: slightly relax the time limit in `test_train_bpe_speed`.

### Fixed

- code: fix an issue in the `train_bpe` tests where the expected merges and vocab did
  not properly reflect tiebreaking with the lexicographically greatest pair.
  - This occurred because our reference implementation (which checks against HF)
    follows the GPT-2 tokenizer in remapping bytes that aren't human-readable to
    printable unicode strings. To match the HF code, we were erroneously tiebreaking
    on this remapped unicode representation instead of the original bytes.
- handout: fix the expected number of non-embedding parameters for model with
  recommended TinyStories hyperparameters (section 7.2).
- handout: replace `<|endofsequence|>` with `<|endoftext|>` in the `decoding` problem.
- code: fix the setup command (`pip install -e .'[test]'`)to improve zsh compatibility.
- handout: fix various trivial typos and formatting errors.
